# spell-checker

 A spelling checker application based on Norwig's blog ( http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html )  implemented in Java.
 It basically stores the words of 'big.txt' in HashMap and then looks for the word if not found then lists all the one and two edit  distant words and then recommends the onr with highest number of occurence.
